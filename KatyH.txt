Hello!

My name is Katy Hollobaugh.

Three words which describe me are: extroverted, pessimistic, and germophobic.

My favorite hobby is gaming. I like to stay inside most of the time during daylight hours and play games
like Fortnight and GTA.

My favorite animals are tiny dogs that bark constantly and attack when you try to pet them!
