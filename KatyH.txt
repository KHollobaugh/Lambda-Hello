Hello!

My name is Katy Hollobaugh.

Three words which describe me are: extroverted, pessimistic, and germophobic.

My favorite hobby is searching the forests of Appalachia for signs of Bigfoot. Each year I go on a camping trip
deep into the Appalachian Mountains where I spend weeks searching for footprints and other evidence. When I inevitable
find evidence, I share it with my secret society and various research facilities.

My favorite animals are tiny dogs that bark constantly and attack when you try to pet them!
